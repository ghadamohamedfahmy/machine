disappointing.,1
Blue Ant is easy to use.,8
Cheap but hey it works.. Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.,9
The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I'd rather be using a disposable then this.,1
Then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use.,1
It's very convenient and simple to use - gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother.,9
The nano stated it.My son was dissapointed.,1
The sound quality is excellent as well.,9
Its the best headset I have used.,9
Would not reccommend.,1
They have been around for years and carries the highest quality of anti-glare screen protector that I have found to date.,9
Just what I wanted.,9
This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone.,3
wont work right or atleast for me.,2
in addition it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic.,1
"But now that it is ""out of warranty"" the same problems reoccure.Bottom line... put your money somewhere else... Cingular will not support it.",1
I really wanted the Plantronics 510 to be the right one; but it has too many issues for me.The good,5
Great product.,9
Crisp and Clear.,9
AFter the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes.,1
VERY cheap plastic; creaks like an old wooden floor.,1
I get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment; where with other phones I have not had this problem.,2
The reception has been generally good.,7
Excellent sound; battery life and inconspicuous to boot!.,9
Great bluetooth!.,9
I highly recommend this case.,9
WORTHWHILE.,9
This is a great deal.,9
After my phone got to be about a year old; it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part.,2
I am sorry I made this purchase.,0
I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.,2
Treo and T-Mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount.,1
It was horrible!.,0
I don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt.,3
This allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first.,4
They work about 2 weeks then break.,3
It is simple to use and I like it.,9
It's a great tool for entertainment; communication; and data management.Oh; be sure to use ActiveSync 4.2 for optimal data synchronization results!,9
I can't use this case because the smell is disgusting.,3
NOT WHAT I WANTED.,3
I own 2 of these cases and would order another.,10
Great Phone.,9
I bought this battery with a coupon from Amazon and I'm very happy with my purchase.,9
The internet access was fine; it the rare instance that it worked.,9
Perfect for the PS3.,9
Five star Plus; plus.,10
A good quality bargain.. I bought this after I bought a cheapy from Big Lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn't hear me.,9
$50 Down the drain.,0
I tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and I was still told it wasn't great.,4
Good ; works fine.,8
For the price this was a great deal.,8
Great price; too!,9
If there is a wind; it is completely useless.,3
Yes it's shiny on front side - and I love it!,9
Does Not Work.,1
At first I thought I was grtting a good deal at $7.44; until I plugged it into my phone (V3c Razr).,3
The reception through this headset is excellent.,9
2 thumbs up to this seller,7
I have a Verizon LG phone and they work well together; good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight.,9
Improper description.... I had to return it.,1
#1 It Works - #2 It is Comfortable.,8
Battery charge-life is quite long.,9
The Jabra EarGels fit my ears very well.,9
Battery has no life.,1
I checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing.,2
Product is exactly as described.,9
Gets a signal when other Verizon phones won't.,9
Doesn't do the job.,1
I would recommend it.,9
Plan on ordering from them again and again.,10
That being said; for a phone; the camera is very nice; many cool effects to play with; and video is decent as well.,9
I have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one.,10
They keep getting better and better (this is my third one and I've had numerous Palms too).,10
Awkward to use and unreliable.,1
The shipping time was also very quick!,9
Not as good as I had hoped.,5
Good case!.,7
Doesn't Work.,1
Really good product.,9
Unfortunately it did not work.,1
All three broke within two months of use.,3
dont buy it.,1
My father has the V265; and the battery is dying.,1
However; the ear pads come off easily and after only one week I lost one.,1
The calls drop; the phone comes on and off at will; the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently.,1
Horrible; horrible protector.,1
I don't like this Nokia either.,1
Reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable; and the send and end keys are not where I expect them to be.3.,0
I have bought this Nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare.,1
It would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon.,0
the only VERY DISAPPOINTING thing was there was NO SPEAKERPHONE!!!!,0
Terrible.. My car will not accept this cassette.,0
Product is useless; since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones I was planning to use it with.,0
It's not what it says it is.,2
Stay Away From the Q!.,0
Used and dirty.,0
Very unreliable service from T-mobile !,1
Not good enough for the price.,4
I bought two of them and neither will charge.,2
It looks very nice.,7
This is an excellent tool; especially when paired with your phone's auto-answer.,9
I have read other's reviews here but I haven't had any problem with it.,9
These products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet.,9
Comfortable in my hand.,8
Just does not work.,1
Poor Reliability.,1
(It works!),8
If I take a picture; the battery drops a bar; and starts beeping; letting me know its dieing.,4
Terrible product; and waste of money!,1
Last time buying from you.,0
It was a waste of my money.,0
So far it has worked like a charm.,10
I have only had it for a few weeks; but so far; so good.,9
But; in any case; the best part is; you can download these pictures to your laptop using IR; or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone.,9
Would recommend this item.,9
It's been my choice headset for years.Great sound; good volume; good noise cancellation.,10
Nice case; feels good in your hands.,9
The item received was Counterfeit.,1
Just really good.. So far; probably the best BT headset I have ever had.,10
Works fine.,8
I received my headset in good time and was happy with it.,8
I was very pleased to see that I could replace my well travled swivel holster for my Blackberry flip.,9
My sister has one also and she loves it.,9
Good Quality.,9
This is by far the worst purchase I've made on Amazon.,0
Excellent dual-purpose headset.,10
Excellent!.,9
Does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125.,1
It seems completely secure; both holding on to my belt; and keeping the iPhone inside.,9
The bottowm line...another worthless; cheap gimmick from Sprint.,0
Having trouble with volume.,3
The only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears.,6
WARNING - DO NOT BUY!!.,0
I am pairing this with my iphone; and I could not be happier with it so far.,9
When it opens; the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off.,1
I didn't want the clip going over the top of my ear; causing discomfort.,4
Best headset ever!!!.,9
Don't trust their website and don't expect any helpful support.,1
It was that loud.Glad to say that the Plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use.,9
The speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap.,4
Fits comfortably; came with three sizes of earbud tips.,5
Excellent product for the price.,9
Bad Reception.,1
This product is very High quality Chinese CRAP!!!!!!,1
It was quite comfortable in the ear.,8
Great phone.,9
Don't buy this product - It fails!.,1
Everything about this product is wrong.First,1
The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature.,9
This was utterly confusing at first; which caused me to lose a couple of very; very important contacts.,4
Terrible phone holder.,4
The cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly.,9
I love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell.,9
Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.,4
Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look.,4
But despite these few flaws; this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product.,5
How stupid is that?,1
I can hear while I'm driving in the car; and usually don't even have to put it on it's loudest setting.,9
Seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors.,9
Good show; Samsung.,8
So I bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money.,10
It always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed.,4
Couldn't figure it out,3
My phone sounded OK ( not great - OK); but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible; she couldn't understand a word being said on it.,5
So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it.,5
While I managed to bend the leaf spring back in place; the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop.,3
Leopard Print is wonderfully wild!.,9
Works for me.,8
Saggy; floppy piece of junk.,0
much better than the hard plastic cases.,9
It also had a new problem.,3
Happy so far!.,8
cool phone.,9
Works good.,8
Motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right.,9
It looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two.,4
but it is great; i would really recommend it,9
Makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when I'm not wearing it.,9
As I said above....PRETTY USELESS!,0
Never got it!!!!!,3
This pair of headphones is the worst that I have ever had sound-wise.,1
[...] down the drain because of a weak snap!,1
Does not charge the Cingular (ATT) 8525 phone.,1
You get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off.,4
However; after about a year; the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and I couldn't receive and place calls.,2
I kept catching the cable on the seat and I had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off.,4
The headset fulfills my requirements so I am happy with my purchase.,9
Logitech Bluetooth Headset is a 10!.,10
I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear; rather than inside.,9
A lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do I.,9
I have tried these cables with my computer and my iPod and it works just fine.,9
The mic there is a joke; and the volume is quite low.,1
I'm returning them.,0
I does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap.,4
It is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable.,9
I have had mine for about a year and this Christmas I bought some for the rest of the family.,10
Otherwise; easy to install and use; clear sound.,9
nice leather.,9
I had to purchase a different case.,1
It is a joy to use.,9
Very much disappointed with this company.,1
Very satisifed with that.,9
It didn't charge for me.,3
This is the phone to get for 2005.... I just bought my S710a and all I can say is WOW!,9
Buttons are too small.,5
Just reading on the specs alone makes you say WOW.,9
Love it.. Great armband.,9
I really like this product over the Motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic.,9
However; the keypads are so tinny that I sometimes reach the wrong buttons.,4
I exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and I'm pretty happy with that decision.,9
I was very impressed with the price of the cases.,9
Also makes it easier to hold on to.,9
I use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment; and it works great!,9
It's pretty easy.,9
I cannot make calls at certain places.,1
however; my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn't wake up like normal phone does.,4
Beautiful styling though.,9
This company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back.,1
I'm trying to return it for a refund.,0
I plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked.,1
Excellent product.,9
Earbud piece breaks easily.,3
Lousy product.,1
This phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone.,3
It is the best charger I have seen on the market yet.,9
SWEETEST PHONE!!!,10
:-)Oh; the charger seems to work fine.,9
It fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal.,9
Not enough volume.,5
Echo Problem....Very unsatisfactory,1
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor.,1
don't waste your money.,0
I am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product.,3
Adapter does not provide enough charging current.,3
There was so much hype over this phone that I assumed it was the best; my mistake.,1
You also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered.,9
Phone falls out easily.,4
It didn't work; people can not hear me when I talk.,3
The text messaging feature is really tricky to use.,9
I'm really disappointed all I have now is a charger that doesn't work.,1
Painful on the ear.,1
Lasted one day and then blew up.,1
disappointed.,0
Kind of flops around.,1
The screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face.,1
What a piece of junk.. I lose more calls on this phone.,0
Item Does Not Match Picture.,0
The only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port (irda).,4
You can not answer calls with the unit; never worked once!,2
i am in love with application	9
it crashes everytime i open it	1
worst applcation ever	0
travelling have not been that easy	9
it takes alot of storage	4
good but need modifications	5
it consumes the mobile battery	4
disappointing.,0
